### Hi there, Iâ€™m Rudra ðŸ‘‹

I specialize in Machine Learning and Neural Engineering with a background in statistics, computer science, and mathematics. I love taking initiatives and collaborating, whether through applying ideas from different fields or connecting people from different backgrounds.


Even at the moment, Iâ€™m merging my two fields - Biomedical Engineering & Information Technology - at Columbia to push the boundaries of Brain-Machine Interfaces.
